# WELCOME TO SIMON SAYS!

This is a project for my Web Development Immersive class at General Assembly. 
The assignment was to make a simple game. I chose to make a version of the hand-held game from my childhood, "Simon Says".
The rules of the game are simple. Simon creates random a pattern and you follow. So long as you are able to match his every move, the game
continues.

The focus of the project is to put to practice the fundamental skills we have learned thus far in the program. This includes
HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. Here is a complete list of technologies used in this project:

-HTML5  
-CSS3  
-SCSS  
-Javascript  
-Yeoman  
-Grunt  
-Foundation Framework  
-jQuery   
-Underscore  
-Moqups  
-Git  


Please enjoy this version of the game. I intend to continue developing the program to make the best product I can.
Thank you.
